## Recreating an Android Holo Mockup in HTML, SCSS and JS.
I have chosen to recreate an Android OS as Android is my preferred mobile OS. 

Some of my earliest smartphones have been the Nexus 5, and Nexus 6P, which to this day are some of my favourite devices. To my disappointment Google scrapped the Nexus line to make way for the Pixel line. As a homage to my favourite OS, I've chosen to recreate Android. It follows mainly the Holo Design taking inpiration from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) to Android 4.4 (Kitkat).
