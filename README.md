## Recreating an Android Holo Mockup in HTML, SCSS and JS.
Inside is a project where we basically create a Fake OS using what we've learnt so far with HTML, SCSS and JS.

Some of my earliest smartphones have been the Nexus 5, and Nexus 6P, which to this day are some of my favourite devices. To my disappointment Google scrapped the Nexus line to make way for the Pixel line. So as a homage to Android, that is what I'll be recreating for this project. Following the provided screenshot, this is mainly based on Google's Holo Design spanning from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) to Android 4.4 (Kitkat).
